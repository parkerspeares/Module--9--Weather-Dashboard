09 Servers and APIs: Weather Dashboard
Your Task
External APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in their context, frequently consuming this data via a server.

Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard application that calls the OpenWeather API and renders data in the browser.

The application’s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Render.

Use the 5-day weather forecast API to retrieve weather data for cities.

The base URL should look like the following:

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}
After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys.

User Story
AS A traveler

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, a description of the weather for the icon's alt tag, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
Mock-Up
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

The weather app includes a search option, a list of cities, and a 5-day forecast and current weather conditions for Atlanta 

Getting Started
On the back end, the application should include a searchHistory.json file that will be used to store and retrieve cities using the fs module.

The following HTML route should be created:

GET * should return the index.html file.
The following API routes should be created:

GET /api/weather/history should read the searchHistory.json file and return all saved cities as JSON.

POST /api/weather should receive a city name to save on the request body, add it to the searchHistory.json file, and then return associated weather data to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each city name a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).

Refer to the Full-Stack Blog on deploying to Render and the Render documentation on setting environment variables.

💡 Hints
Using the 5-day weather forecast API, you'll notice that you'll need to pass in coordinates instead of just a city name. Using the OpenWeatherMap APIs, how could we retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name?

How could we make the OpenWeather API calls server-side, parse the data, and then send the parsed data client-side?

🏆 Bonus
This application offers the DELETE functionality on the front end. As a bonus, try to add the DELETE route to the application using the following guideline:

DELETE /api/weather/history/:id should receive a route parameter that contains the id of a city name to delete. To delete a city, you'll need to read all the cities from the searchHistory.json file, remove the city with the given id property, and then rewrite the cities to the searchHistory.json file.
